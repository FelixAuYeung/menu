# menu
a simple library of implementation of menu on MCU
This library is written by Felix AuYeung

Under the library, menu entries are organised as a table, with a unique index number.
The relationships between entries are based on those indices.
Particularly, index 0 is for the main menu.
Also, menu table is ended with a end token.

Have fun with the library, and I look forward to getting any feedback.
